# 2020-debate-transcripts

- With the presidential election coming up, I thought it would be interesting to analyze the current debates. To get started, we need to gather and clean the transcripts. See here for a quick-and-dirty start. Any/all input is very welcome!

- Also, this is my first time posting a public repository. Please offer some feedback if you can. I have included all code and commentary in the .Rmd file. Should I also include an entire script without the comments?
